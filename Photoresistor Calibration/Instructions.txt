1. To collect data, set up the Lumas in a room that's right on the auto-dim threshold. That is, if the room was any darker, you'd want the heart to be dim. Better if the room is slightly too bright than slightly too dark.

2. Next, set up a PC on the same network and run the PhotoResistorReceiveValues python program on it. Make sure to change the IP address in both that and the PhotoResistorSendValues program.

3. After that, upload PhotoResistorSendValues to a Lumas and run it. It will take about 12 hours to complete.

4. You can generate an equation from the results using the python curve fitting program
