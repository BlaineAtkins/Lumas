Washington B&O / Excise Taxes are due each quarter. Stripe should be set to automatically generate the CSV of itemized transactions w/ taxes each quarter (in the tax section of the dashboard).

Once you have that file, you can run this python script and it will output the three numbers needed to file quarterly B&O taxes on My DOR.
1. Total of sales in Washington State
2. Sales Tax collected in Washington State
3. Total of out-of-state sales (to be deducted from WA tax obligation)
